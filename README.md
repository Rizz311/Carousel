# Slot Machine
This is a jquery project that I made in class for which utilizes a few skills that I picked up and are polishing up.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Arrays, and If Else.
In the HTML I have a section that is nesting an img tag. I have simple CSS to give it a bit of pazazz. The real magic is within my javascript. I have an array of images that I use to cycle the image source in the HTML and change the image on the click of the back or next button.

## Optimizations
I have had the code working but I changed it for a class project and added a random generator that will give you a random picture on the third click I want to change it back to the way it was before that and cycle thru the chain.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned about using arrays to cycles and change the source of an images just one of many ways I can use an array and am still learning more about arrays.
## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
